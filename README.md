}
}

* 1.4 public class GandhiQuote //Class name
{
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    {
         System.out.print("\"Live as if you were to die tomorrow.\n\tLearn as if you were to live forever\". \n-Mahatma Gandhi");

    } // End method main
} // End class Gandhi




* 1.5/**
 * About Me
 * John Rocha
 * 8/16/17
 * Ms.Rioux
 * */
public class John //Class name
 {
public static void main (String[] args)
{

  } // End method main
  
 }// End class John



* Extra (If you did either one) public class MuddyWater 
 {

public static void main (String[] args)

{
     System.out.println("Let Muddy Water Sit and It Grows Clear");

 System.out.println("\nIt's clear when, in membranous\n\tpredawn blue \n"
 + "I enter pines, mind on \n\tembryo in amnion,");
 
  System.out.println("\n my tracks preceded\n\t\tby those of the dog, \n"
 + " his by a doe's, hers by six \n\thours of snow, it's clear then");
 
 System.out.println("\n the distance between\n\tmy affections and ability\n\b" +
"to touch their sinuosity \n\t  is itself a felt silence ");

System.out.println("\n called sun. Sun rises \n\t without provocation\n\b" + 
"over a frozen stream that frustrates\n\t reflection, but will");

System.out.println("\n by the time a pulse is palpable,\n\t\thave thawed and grown  \n"
 + " clear again, permitting me to see \n\t\t a tree surface, distort, flow.");
 
 System.out.println("\n -Ted Mathys");
